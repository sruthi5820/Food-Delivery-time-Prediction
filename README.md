## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **food delivery time prediction model**. The goal is to accurately estimate delivery times for customer orders.

By predicting delivery times effectively, food delivery platforms can:

* Enhance customer experience
* Optimize delivery logistics
* Improve overall operational efficiency

## 📝 Steps Followed

1. **Data Collection** – Gathered food delivery dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Cleaned missing values, handled outliers, engineered features.
3. **Model Development** – Trained regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost).
4. **Model Evaluation** – Compared performance using **MSE, RMSE, and R² score**.
5. **Deployment** – Built a standalone app for real-time delivery time predictions.

---

## 📈 Results and Evaluation Criterion

* The best-performing model was **XGBoost** with an **R² score of 0.82**.
* Evaluation Metrics Used:

  * Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  * Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  * R² Score

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

* Incorporate additional features (e.g., delivery partner behavior, live traffic, real-time weather).
* Conduct deeper data analysis for hidden patterns.
* Hyperparameter tuning for further performance improvements.
* Scale the web app for production use with APIs.
